Below are the library and development RPMs for xine-lib version 1.2.6.  Be sure to check out the [About the xine RPMs][abt] post for information on how these were built.

[xine-lib][] - The main xine library
[xine-lib-dev][] - The development xine library (needed if you're building an interface against xine-lib)
[xine-lib-doc][] - Documentation

You'll also need a user interface - as of this release, the most current release of [xine-ui is 0.99.9][ui], and the most current release of [gxine is 0.5.908][gxine].

(To save disk space, only the current release and two prior releases in the 1.2-series will be maintained.)
