Below is the RPM for xine-ui version 0.99.8. See the [About the xine RPMs][abt] post for information on how this RPM was built.

[xine-ui][] - The user interface

To use this, you'll also need xine-lib - as of this release, the most recent release of [xine-lib is 1.1.21][lib].

(To save disk space, only the current release and two [prior releases][pri] will be maintained.)
