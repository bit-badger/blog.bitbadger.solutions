summary: Information about how xine RPMs are built
---

_(This post is updated regularly, and should contain the most up-to-date information about these RPMs.)_

Xine is a full-featured media player for Linux, that can play CDs, DVDs, VCDs, MP3s, Ogg, and more. The main site for xine is [www.xine-project.org][] - you can find information, install instructions, and more user interfaces. These RPMs should work on White Box Enterprise Linux (WBEL), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and CentOS. To stay up-to-date on these releases, you can subscribe to the [RSS feed][] for this category.

_As with any standard disclaimer, no warranty is expressed or implied - these RPMs are provided as-is, and we assume no responsibility for any ill effects that may come from the downloading and installation of these files. However, feedback is welcome if you encounter problems with these RPMs._

**Note:** To use xine, you'll need both the library and the UI. To play commercial DVDs, you'll need libdvdcss, which is not provided here (but, knowing the name, you should be able to find it).
