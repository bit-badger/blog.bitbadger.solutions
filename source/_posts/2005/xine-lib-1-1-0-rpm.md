Below are the library and development RPMs for xine-lib version 1.1.0. Be sure to check out the [About the xine RPMs][abt] post for more information.

xine-lib - The main xine library
xine-lib-devel - The development xine library (needed if you're building an interface against xine-lib)

You'll also need a user interface - as of this release, the most current release of [xine-ui is 0.99.4][ui].

(To save disk space, only the current release and two [prior releases][pri] will be maintained.)
