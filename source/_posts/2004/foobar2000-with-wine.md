summary: A nice, lightweight Windows audio player working under wine
---

[foobar2000][] is about the best, most organized audio player I've found. However, it is a Windows application, and according to what I've read, very reliant on Microsoft C++ extensions. I decided to give it a shot under wine, and it works great! There is a repaint problem - sometimes the playlist doesn't refresh as it should. But, it's pretty much a start-and-minimize sort of application, so that's acceptable.
