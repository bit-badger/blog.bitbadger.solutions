summary: A bit of C++ knowledge should help when compiling programs for Linux
---

Compiling my own versions of programs when trying to get DVD stuff working intrigued me. I've tried a couple of times to teach myself C++, but hadn't really gotten that far. My understanding of some of the concepts has improved some, and I've also found a good set of tutorials on [C Programming][]'s web site. I went though the tutorials, and got some interesting things working. This was PC-based, using the [CygWin][] Linux emulator. I actually understood everything I wrote, which is a very nice feeling! This knowledge should come in handy if I ever have trouble compiling something...
