summary: 'The "yum" updater works nicely'
---

I wasn't able to sleep very well last night, so I didn't do much tonight. One thing I did do, though, was run [yum][], which is, at a high-level, similar to Windows Update. WBEL recently released "Respin 1" (that's re-spin, not a new name - it's code name is still "Liberation"), and running yum with no options will update every available package. After about 30 minutes of watching it download stuff, I went to bed - I'll have to verify the results tomorrow.
