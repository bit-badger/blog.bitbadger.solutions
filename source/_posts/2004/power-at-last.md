summary: The power supply arrives, but a background program is locking the machine up hard
---

Upon returning from vacation, I found that the power supply was finally here. After installing it, I fired up the computer, and it works! I fired up my e-mail client (to pull all the mail off the server that I had received for the past few weeks), and downloaded the [Folding@Home][] (F@H) client for Linux. I've been running that on a couple of other computers (user name LX_i, team #37825), and I'll probably write more about it in particular in my regular blog. Anyway, once I got that started, I started reading the e-mail I had missed. Then, the machine locked up!

I reset the machine, and repeated the steps (started Evolution, started F@H), and before long, it happened again. I restarted them both again, but it's getting late - I'll have to continue this tomorrow.
