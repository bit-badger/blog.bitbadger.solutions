Despite being ill early in the day (which caused me to miss Sunday School and church), the day on the computer went pretty well. I made a lot more progress on TMTS, although I ran into a problem - it appears that the [PHP][] that came with WBEL may not have [MySQL][] support enabled. Rather than get sidelined with this right now, I'm going to continue converting pages on the application, and work this issue as part of unit testing.

I also managed to catch up on comp.lang.cobol and comp.sys.unisys, two newsgroups in which I participate. I was able to play a file off a DVD (although I still can't play the disc itself).


[PHP]:   //www.php.net
[MySQL]: //www.mysql.com
