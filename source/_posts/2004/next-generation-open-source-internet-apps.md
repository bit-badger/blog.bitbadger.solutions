In setting up my "I'm gonna use this for a while" environment on WXP, I've stumbled across what I feel are two gems. These are the [FireFox][] browser (which I've been using for a while now) and the [Thunderbird][] mail program. Thunderbird is not as fully featured as Ximian Evolution, but I prefer it's interface to that of Mozilla Mail. I also think that once I get back on Linux on a regular basis, I'll install the same version there, and see if I can get my mail to use the same data files whether I'm using Linux or WXP.
