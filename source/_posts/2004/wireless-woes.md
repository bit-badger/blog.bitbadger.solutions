summary: First attempts at a wireless adapter fail spectacularly
---

My wife bought me a wireless network card, so I could move the second computer out of the living room (or, as she calls it, "not a computer lab!"). :) Everything works okay under WXP, but when I boot to Linux, no joy. (I sort of expected that, at this point...) I downloaded the Red Hat 8 drivers from [iBlitzz's website][ib], but the interface for a network card is what's called a "kernel module," which is, as best I can tell, a highly-specialized object module that tells the kernel all the details of the hardware. At any rate, the kernel module is very much tied to a particular version of kernel, so the RH8 doesn't seem to be working. Oh well - time to play with my new toy - WXP for now.
