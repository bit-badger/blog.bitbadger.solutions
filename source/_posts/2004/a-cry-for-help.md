summary: The difficulties of downloading things when the network doesn't work
---

I tried a few other things to make that module work, but nothing seemed to help. It's also very difficult to download and try new things when you can't get to the Internet to download them. I also posted a message to the WBEL user's list, and rather than go into that detail, that message can be found [here][].
