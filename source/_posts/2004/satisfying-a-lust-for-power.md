summary: A new (inexpensive) power supply has been found
---

Searching for power supplies was very interesting. I determined that I needed at least a 300W supply, and considered upgrading case and all. Some of the bigger stores, such as [Best Buy][], [Office Depot][], and [OfficeMax][], revealed nothing under $30 (just for the power supply). I checked some other sites, such as [Tiger Direct][] and [TCWO][], and found one for $17 on Tiger Direct. I thought that was pretty good, and was planning on ordering it, when a friend (the person I bought the computer from) found one on [PC Direct Source][] for $10. I'll probably order it tomorrow.
