In an effort to cleanse my wife's computer of the spyware that dogged it so, I removed all the Linux partitions from my computer to make space for files. I got her computer rebuilt, and I'll be starting from scratch when I get back into it. No worries, though - if I'm going to get any good at setting it up... Kind of reminds me of a joke - a guy in New York asks an old man on the street, "Hey, how do you get to Radio City Music Hall?" The old guy responds, "Practice, practice, practice!"

In looking toward renewed Linux experimentation, I downloaded the .ISO files for FC2. I'm going to start with that, and see if I have any better luck getting my network card to work.
