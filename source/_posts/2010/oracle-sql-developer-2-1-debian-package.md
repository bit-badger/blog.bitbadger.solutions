summary: A newer version of SQL Developer is available

It had been a while since I had updated SQL Developer. It turns out that version 2.1 was released March 1st of this year. I've downloaded it and created a Debian package. It can be [downloaded][deb] from the [DJS Consulting Linux Software Repository][repo].

I've used it with Sun's Java 6 Update 18; I have not tested it with OpenJDK. If you have problems getting it to work, you may want to check the [previous post][post] on this topic.
