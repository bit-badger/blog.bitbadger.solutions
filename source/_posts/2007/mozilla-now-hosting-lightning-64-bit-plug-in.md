Just when I get a nice system set up here, lo and behold, Mozilla now has a 64-bit Linux plug-in available. It can be [obtained from their FTP site][ftp] (link for version 0.5). <del>I'll continue to keep the version I have here available, in case this dries up.</del> _(UPDATE: It's gone.)_ But, unless that does, this is probably the last post you'll see here about the 64-bit Lightning plug-in.
