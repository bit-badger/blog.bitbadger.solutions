Welcome to The Bit Badger Blog. This blog is a place where I plan to posts tips and other information regarding technology (AKA "geek stuff"). This will allow me to keep [my personal blog][pers] non-technical.

I have imported my old "My Linux Adventure" posts from 2004 here, to allow the to be indexed and searchable. I noticed, in the process, that some of the information is somewhat dated - take it for what it's worth, which is twice what you paid for it!

I hope that the information here will be beneficial to you.
