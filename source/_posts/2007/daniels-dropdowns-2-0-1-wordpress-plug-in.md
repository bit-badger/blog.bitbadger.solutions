summary: A quick bug fix
---

I have released version 2.0.1 of Daniel's DropDowns, the [WordPress][] plug-in that provides category and archive dropdown template tags. It is available on [its page at the WordPress Plug-In Directory][pi].

This was a minor change - the auto-navigating lists added in version 2 needed a slight tweak. There wasn't a "select category" entry, so one could not navigate to the first item in the list without going somewhere else first. The category dropdown now has this entry, and is consistent with the archive dropdown.

Enjoy!

_(UPDATE: This plug-in is inactive, as its functionality is now part of WordPress core.)_
