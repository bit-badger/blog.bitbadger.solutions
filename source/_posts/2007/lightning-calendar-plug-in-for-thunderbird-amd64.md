[Mozilla Sunbird][] is a calendar project that's being designed as a sister program to Thunderbird and Firefox. It's now at the 0.5 version, and there is a plug-in that integrates Sunbird with Thunderbird, called [Lightning][]. It allows you to not only have a calendar, but send and receive meeting requests as well.

I'm running Thunderbird 2 under Ubuntu Feisty Fawn (7.04) on the AMD64 architecture, and could not find a pre-compiled version of this that worked. So, I decided to give it a shot. It was pretty easy, and the result is a plug-in that works with the AMD64 version of Thunderbird! Since I had trouble finding it, I thought I would share it.

Since I have just started using it, I haven't wrung it out, or tested all the options. Use at your own risk, etc.

<del>You can download the plug-in here</del> _(UPDATE: See [this post][].)_ Happy storming! ;)
