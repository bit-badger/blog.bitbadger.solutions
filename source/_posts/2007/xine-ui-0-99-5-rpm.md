Below is the RPM for xine-ui version 0.99.5. This RPM has been built a little differently. First, it was built on Ubuntu Linux and converted to RPM using alien. Second, I could not quickly figure out how to get the files tagged for the 0.99.5 release, so this build includes changes committed after the official 0.99.5 release. I ran the UI through some paces, and no glaring errors jumped out. Be sure to check out the [About the xine RPMs][abt] post for more information.

xine-ui - The user interface

To use this, you'll also need xine-lib - as of this release, the most recent release of [xine-lib is 1.1.7][lib].

(To save disk space, only the current release and two [prior releases][pri] will be maintained.)
