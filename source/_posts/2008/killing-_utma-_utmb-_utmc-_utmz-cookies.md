For those of us who are cookie-conscious as we surf the web, you're aware that a lot of sites give cookies with names like _utma, _utmb, _utmc, and _utmz. It turns out that these cookies come from Google Analytics.

However, using AdBlock Plus, there is an easy way to kill it. To put in a filter for it, click the "ABP" stop sign icon, and click the "New Filter..." button. Enter "http://www.google-analytics.com/\*" and press Enter. That's it! Those _utm* cookies are now a thing of the past.
