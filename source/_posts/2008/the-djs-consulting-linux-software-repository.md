summary: A new place to find all the software we host
---

We have created a software repository, where users can browse files that may be available. The base location is [https://hosted.djs-consulting.com/software][repo]. Within there, there are a few areas.

* [/sled][] and [/opensuse][] - These contain add-on CD images for SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED) and openSUSE, created by [Mike Petersen][pcc]. These add-ons provide multimedia and gaming capabilities that don't come with SLED unless you purchase the support or compile them yourselves. These images can be added as resources in YaST.
* [/xine][] - This contains the 64-bit RPMs for xine (the latest three), both xine-lib and xine-ui. New releases will continue to get their own posts, but that's where they will be.

Enjoy!
