summary: Posts have been delayed due to work on a volunteer effort in Albuquerque, New Mexico
---

Sorry for the lack of new content (although I did download and build the latest release of xine). I've been working on a community-based volunteer effort in Albuquerque, New Mexico called [Not So Extreme Makeover: Community Edition][nsx]. I'm handling the public website, as well as a private side that the leaders can use to track lots of different things. I'm going to have some good stuff I've discovered out here once we're done (along with lots of praise to heap on [PostgreSQL][pg] - I have a new "most favorite" open source database), but for the rest of March, I'll likely be incommunicado.

Happy Easter - see you in April!
