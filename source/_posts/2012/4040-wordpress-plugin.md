---

The WordPress plugin for the 40/40 Prayer Vigil has just been published! You can download it from your plugin menu, or by visiting [its home on the WordPress Plugin Directory][pi].

The plugin provides a widget that utilizes [the web service about which we previously wrote][post] to display the prayer guide for each day. You can configure whether you want it to display 40 days or 40 hours; what language to retrieve; the translation version for the Scripture links displayed with each day's guide; and the number of overlap days (it will display a "Coming Soon" entry before and a "Thanks for Praying" entry after). Use is pretty simple; just drop it into a widgetized area of your theme. It will probably look best with at least 200 horizontal pixels, although it will wrap to any sort of narrowness.

Version 2012.0 is the version that's up there now. The Spanish translations of the options menu is not done yet, but you can specify Spanish prayer guides. Version 2012.1 will contain the localized options menu. If you run into any problems using it, you can submit issues against it at its WordPress Plugin Directory page.
